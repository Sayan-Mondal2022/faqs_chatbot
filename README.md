# FAQs Chatbot

A smart chatbot that can understand travel-related questions and give quick and helpful answers. It uses machine learning and language processing to talk like a human and respond correctly.

--- 

## 🖥️ User Interface Overview

The FAQs Chatbot's user interface is designed to be simple, responsive, and interactive, making it easy for users to ask questions and receive answers in real-time.

Key Elements:
- **Chat Window:** A central area where users can type their queries and view responses from the bot.
- **Input Box:** Allows users to enter their travel-related questions.
- **Send Button:** Triggers the chatbot to process the query and display an answer.
- **Bot Response Area:** Dynamically updates to show the chatbot's replies in a conversational format.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using HTML/CSS.

### Interaction Flow:

- User types a question in the input field.
- The query is sent to the Flask backend.
- The model predicts the intent using TensorFlow and NLP (SpaCy).
- A relevant answer is selected and displayed in the chat window.

The chatbot is built using **Flask** as the backend, **HTML/CSS/JS** for the user interface, and tools like **TensorFlow** and **SpaCy** for intent recognition and prediction. A custom intents.json file stores predefined categories and responses.

| Layer            | Technologies Used                                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**     | HTML, CSS, JavaScript                                      |
| **Backend**      | Flask (Python Web Framework)                               |
| **NLP**          | SpaCy (for text preprocessing and tokenization)            |
| **Machine Learning** | TensorFlow (for training and intent classification)     |
| **Data Handling**| Custom `intents.json` file (predefined Q&A dataset)        |
| **Model Format** | `.keras` file (Keras-trained TensorFlow model)                |

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **User Input**  
   The user sends a query via the chatbot interface in the browser.

2. **Frontend to Backend**  
   The input is sent to the Flask backend using JavaScript (typically via a POST request).

3. **Preprocessing & Prediction**  
   The backend uses SpaCy to preprocess the text and passes it to the trained TensorFlow model.

4. **Intent Classification**  
   The model predicts the intent of the user’s query (e.g., flight info, visa, currency).

5. **Response Retrieval**  
   Based on the predicted intent, a matching response is fetched from the `intents.json` file.

6. **Reply to User**  
   The response is sent back to the frontend and displayed in the chat window.

> ⚙️ Behind the scenes, the system uses a simple **rule-based + ML hybrid architecture** to deliver fast and accurate answers to travel-related FAQs.
